# 📊 Analytics System - Dynamic Chart Data

## ✅ What Just Changed

### Before:
- ❌ Chart showed fake data (random 12 months)
- ❌ Always displayed 12 months even for new users
- ❌ Not personalized

### Now:
- ✅ **Chart shows real user data** from MongoDB
- ✅ **Dynamic time range** - Shows only months user has data
- ✅ **New users** - Shows only current month (starting at 0)
- ✅ **Growing users** - Shows 1, 2, 3... months as they earn
- ✅ **Analytics stored** - Daily and monthly breakdowns

## 🏗️ MongoDB Collections

### Daily Analytics
```javascript
{
  userEmail: "customer@example.com",
  date: ISODate("2025-10-10T00:00:00Z"),  // Start of day
  year: 2025,
  month: 10,
  day: 10,
  
  // Transaction stats for this day
  transactionCount: 3,
  totalAmount: 60.00,
  confirmedCount: 3,
  declinedCount: 0,
  
  // LYPTO stats for this day
  lyptoEarned: 120,        // 2% of $60
  lyptoMinted: 120,        // Actually minted on blockchain
  
  // Running total
  cumulativeLypto: 450,    // Total LYPTO up to this day
}
```

### Monthly Analytics
```javascript
{
  userEmail: "customer@example.com",
  year: 2025,
  month: 10,
  monthName: "Oct",
  
  // Transaction stats for this month
  transactionCount: 23,
  totalAmount: 1150.00,
  confirmedCount: 20,
  declinedCount: 3,
  
  // LYPTO stats for this month
  lyptoEarned: 2300,       // 2% of $1150
  lyptoMinted: 2300,       // Actually minted
  
  // Running total
  cumulativeLypto: 2300,   // Total LYPTO up to this month
}
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. **User Makes First Purchase:**
```
Payment confirmed: $10.00
        ↓
Analytics Service creates:
  - DailyAnalytics for today
  - MonthlyAnalytics for this month
        ↓
Chart fetches data: 1 month
        ↓
Chart displays: "Oct" with 20 points
```

### 2. **User Makes More Purchases:**
```
More payments over time
        ↓
Analytics updated daily/monthly
        ↓
Chart shows: "Sep", "Oct" (2 months)
        ↓
Chart shows: "Aug", "Sep", "Oct" (3 months)
        ↓
Eventually shows: Up to 12 months
```

### 3. **New User (No Transactions):**
```
No analytics data in MongoDB
        ↓
Chart shows: Current month with 0 points
        ↓
Message: "Make your first purchase to start earning!"
```

## 📈 Chart Display Logic

### New User (0-1 months):
```
Labels: ["Oct"]
Data:   [0]
Range:  "This month"
```

### Growing User (2-3 months):
```
Labels: ["Sep", "Oct", "Nov"]
Data:   [50, 120, 200]
Range:  "Last 3 months"
```

### Established User (4-12 months):
```
Labels: ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", ..., "Dec"]
Data:   [100, 150, 200, ..., 450]
Range:  "Last 12 months"
```

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Get Monthly Analytics:
```
GET /api/merchant/analytics/monthly?email=customer@example.com

Response:
{
  analytics: [
    {
      month: "Sep",
      year: 2025,
      points: 100,
      cumulativeLypto: 100,
      transactions: 5,
      totalSpent: 50.00
    },
    {
      month: "Oct",
      year: 2025,
      points: 120,
      cumulativeLypto: 220,
      transactions: 6,
      totalSpent: 60.00
    }
  ],
  count: 2
}
```

### Get Daily Analytics:
```
GET /api/merchant/analytics/daily?email=customer@example.com&days=30

Response:
{
  analytics: [
    {
      date: "2025-10-01T00:00:00Z",
      points: 20,
      cumulativeLypto: 200,
      transactions: 1,
      totalSpent: 10.00
    },
    // ... more days
  ],
  count: 10
}
```

### Get User Stats:
```
GET /api/merchant/analytics/stats?email=customer@example.com

Response:
{
  thisMonth: {
    transactions: 6,
    lyptoEarned: 120,
    spent: 60.00
  },
  allTime: {
    transactions: 23,
    lyptoEarned: 460,
    spent: 230.00
  }
}
```

## 💾 When Analytics are Updated

### On Payment Confirmation:
```typescript
// In routes/merchant.ts - confirm-payment endpoint
await updateAnalytics(payment.userEmail, {
  amount: payment.amount,
  lyptoReward: payment.lyptoReward,
  lyptoMinted: payment.lyptoMinted,
  status: payment.status,
  confirmedAt: payment.confirmedAt,
});
```

**This automatically:**
1. ✅ Creates/updates daily analytics for today
2. ✅ Creates/updates monthly analytics for this month
3. ✅ Increments transaction counts
4. ✅ Adds LYPTO earned
5. ✅ Updates cumulative totals

---

## 📊 Dashboard Stats

### Old (Hardcoded):
```javascript
Total Points: 1,250  // ❌ Fake
Monthly Transactions: 23  // ❌ Fake
Monthly Points: +450  // ❌ Fake
```

### New (Real Data):
```javascript
Total Points: user.lyptoBalance  // ✅ Real from MongoDB
Monthly Transactions: thisMonth.transactions  // ✅ Real from analytics
Monthly Points: thisMonth.lyptoEarned  // ✅ Real from analytics
```

## 🎯 Chart Behavior Examples

### Example 1: Brand New User (Oct 12, 2025)
```
User signs up today, no purchases yet

Chart displays:
  Labels: ["Oct"]
  Data:   [0]
  Text:   "This month"
  Growth: "Make your first purchase!"
```

### Example 2: User with 1 Purchase (Oct 12, 2025)
```
User made $10 purchase on Oct 10

MongoDB:
  MonthlyAnalytics: { month: 10, monthName: "Oct", lyptoEarned: 20 }

Chart displays:
  Labels: ["Sep", "Oct"]  (adds previous month with 0)
  Data:   [0, 20]
  Text:   "Last 2 months"
  Growth: "Trending up by 100%"
```

### Example 3: Active User (6 months of history)
```
User has been active since May 2025

MongoDB has:
  - May: 100 points
  - Jun: 150 points
  - Jul: 200 points
  - Aug: 180 points
  - Sep: 220 points
  - Oct: 300 points

Chart displays:
  Labels: ["May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct"]
  Data:   [100, 150, 200, 180, 220, 300]
  Text:   "Last 6 months"
  Growth: "Trending up by 36.4%"
```

## 🔄 Data Flow

```
Payment Confirmed
        ↓
Backend updates:
  1. Payment.lyptoMinted = true
  2. User.lyptoBalance += 20
  3. DailyAnalytics (today) += 20 points
  4. MonthlyAnalytics (Oct) += 20 points
        ↓
Mobile app fetches:
  GET /analytics/monthly?email=...
        ↓
Chart component:
  - Receives real data
  - Shows only available months
  - Calculates growth
  - Displays trend
        ↓
User sees:
  Real-time, personalized chart! ✅
